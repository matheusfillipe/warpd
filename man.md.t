# Overview

A keyboard driven mouse manipulation program for X.

# Usage

warpd [-f] [-l] [-v]

# Args

 **-f**: Run warpd in the foreground (i.e do not daemonize). Mainly useful for debugging.

 **-l**: Prints a list of valid keys which can be used as config values.

 **-v**: Prints the current version.

# Overview

Warp has several modes which can be used to manipulate the mouse. The
default mode is called `normal mode` and allows you to move the mouse
by discrete increments using configurable keybindings (vi based 
by default). In addition to normal mode there exist two other
modes for long distance warping called 'hint and grid mode'.

## Normal Mode (default: `M-c`)

This is the default mode (and the endpoint of both grid and normal mode unless
the *oneshot* option is specified) which is designed for short distance pointer
manipulation. It is particularly useful for manipulating popup menus and
selecting text (see *Dragging*). The default behaviour is vi-like. Pressing
the mapped directional keys (default hjkl) moves the cursor by a fixed
increment but the pointer can also be warped to the edges of the screen using
the home (H), middle (M), and last (L) mappings (see *Config Options*).
Finally a numeric multiplier can be supplied to the directional keys as an
input prefix in order to affect movement in the corresponding direction (e.g
10j moves 10 units down). 

## Hint Mode (default: M-x or simply 'x' within normal mode)

This mode populates the screen with a list of labels and allows the
user to immediately warp the pointer to a given location by pressing the
corresponding key sequence. It is similar to functionality provided by browser
plugins like Vimperator but works outside of the browser and indiscriminately
covers the entire screen. Once a target has been selected `normal mode` is
entered for further manipulation.

By tweaking `hints_nc` and `hints_nr` it should be possible to make most screen
locations accessible with 2-4 key strokes. After a bit of practice the process becomes
second nature and is (in the author's opinion) superior to the grid method for
quickly pinpointing text and UI elements.


## Grid Mode (default: `M-z` or simply 'g' within normal mode)

By default grid mode divides the screen into a 2x2 grid. Each time a key
is pressed the grid shrinks to cover the targeted area. Once the pointer
covers the the desired target a mouse button (e.g `m`) can be pressed.


E.G

```
         +--------+--------+            +--------+--------+
         |        |        |            |  u |  i |       |
         |   u    |   i    |            |----m----+       |
 M-x     |        |        |     u      |  j |  k |       |
----->   +--------m--------+   ----->   +---------+       |
         |        |        |            |                 |
         |   j    |   k    |            |                 |
         |        |        |            |                 |
         +--------+--------+            +--------+--------+
```

# Dragging

Simulating a drag operation can be done by activating one of the movement
modes, moving to the desired starting location and pressing the drag activation
key (default v). At this point the normal mode will activate allowing the user
to move the mouse before pressing the first mouse button to complete the
process. The feature can be useful for highlighting text.

# Scrolling

Inertial scroll can be activated by double tapping the desired scroll key
(buttons 4/5). This is the analogue of 'flinging' the cursor on most trackpads.
Once inertial scroll has been activated (by double tapping) an impulse can be
imparted to the scrolling cursor by tapping the same key. This feature is
particularly useful when navigating through a lot of content (e.g long web pages) but
can effectively be disabled by setting `scroll_fling_timeout` to 1 if desired
(see Config Options).

# Config Options

The following configuration options can be placed in ~/.warprc to modify the
behaviour of the program. Each option must be specified on its own line and
have the format:

```
<option>: <value>
```

{opts}

# Hint Generation

In addition to *hint_characters* hints can be explicitly specified in
`~/.warprc_hints`, if this file exists it is automatically used as a hint
source. Each line contains a hint which is used to populate the screen and may
optionally contain spaces. Spaces are aesthetic and not used during matching.
Note that unlike *hint_characters* (from which hints are generated) this file
contains all of the hints that will be shown on the screen. If hints in this
file are longer than two characters you will likely also want to alter
*hint_width*.


# Examples

## Grid Modification

The following ~/.warprc causes warpd to use a 3 by 3 grid instead of the
default 2 by 2 grid with u,i,o corresponding to the columns in the top row and
n,m,comma corresponding to the columns in the bottom row. The left, middle and
right buttons can be clicked by pressing z, x, and c respectively.

```
grid_nr: 3
grid_nc: 3
grid_keys: u,i,o,j,k,l,n,m,comma
buttons: z,x,c
```

## Hint Specification

The following command might be used to generate a hint file that replicates the default behaviour of warpd.

```
printf "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"| \
awk -vFS='' '{for(j=1;j<=NF;j++) \
		for(i =1;i<=NF;i++) \
			print $i$j}' > ~/.warprc_hints
```

# Notes

## Hint Mode

Rather than saturating the screen with labels it is recommended that the user
leave a few gaps and then use the movement keys (hjkl) to move to the final
location. The rationale for this is as follows: 

- **Efficiency**: A large number of labels necessitates the use of longer
  keysequences (since there are a finite number of two-key sequences) at which
  point the value of the label system is supplanted by manual mouse movement.

- **Usability**: Packing every inch of the screen with labels causes a loss of
  context by obscuring UI elements.

## On Dragging

Activating discrete mode and pressing v can provide a familiar environment to a
*vi* user but it is important to remember that pointer manipulation is
application agnostic and consequently ignorant of the text on the screen. All
movement is necessarily based on *movement_increment*. consequently drag + hint
mode can be a superior method for surgically selecting text (though it may at
first be less intuitive).

# Limitations/Bugs

- No multi monitor support (it may still work by treating the entire display as
  one giant screen, I haven't tried this). If you use this program and desire
  this feature feel free to harass me via email or file an issue on github.

- Programs which use Xinput to directly manipulate input devices may misbehave.
